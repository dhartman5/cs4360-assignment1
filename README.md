# assignment1

My flutter app for assignment 1. 

## How to Run

To run, clone the repository and navigate to the root file. Start up your android studio emulator (I used a pixel 4 max running android 30). 

To have it run on that android emulator, run:

$ flutter run --no-sound-null-safety

To have it run on Web, run:

$ flutter run -d chrome --no-sound-null-safety
